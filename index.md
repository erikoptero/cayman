Let me introduce myself, I’m Eric (25) from Barcelona (Spain), I work in a factory  and in april I will move to Japan to study (I’m going to study there).

I want to buy a DSLR camera for taking pictures and videos of my daily life in Japan and share it with you.

With all the costs of the language academy, apartment, groceries and flights I don’t have enought money to buy it.

I don’t want anything expensive, a begginer camerA like the Canon 700D/760D, Nikon D5300/D5500.

You can find me on twitter and instagram: **erikoptero**

I always have a fascination for Japan and I want to share my experience with you through pictures and videos.

You can see some of the pictures I take in Japan this summer with the LG G4 camera.
